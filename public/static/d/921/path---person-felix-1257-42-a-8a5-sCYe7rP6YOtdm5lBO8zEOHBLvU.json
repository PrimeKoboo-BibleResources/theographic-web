He appears to have expected a bribe from Paul, and therefore had several interviews with him. The \"worthy deeds\" referred to in  <a href=\"http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/24-2.html\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/acts/24-2.html\">24:2</a>  was his clearing the country of banditti and impostors.  <p> At the end of a two years' term, Porcius Festus was appointed in the room of Felix (A.D. 60), who proceeded to Rome, and was there accused of cruelty and malversation of office by the Jews of Caesarea. The accusation was rendered nugatory by the influence of his brother Pallas with Nero. (See Josephus, Ant. xx. 8,9.)  <p> Drusilla, the daughter of Herod Agrippa, having been induced by Felix to desert her husband, the king of Emesa, became his adulterous companion. She was seated beside him when Paul \"reasoned\" before the judge. When Felix gave place to Festus, being \"willing to do the Jews a pleasure,\" he left Paul bound.","Aliases":"Felix","Father":null,"Has_Been_to":[{"data":{"Place_Lookup":"Caesarea.266","ESV_name":"Caesarea"}},{"data":{"Place_Lookup":"Antipatris.70","ESV_name":"Antipatris"}}],"Events":[{"data":{"Event_Name":"Paul sent to Felix","Start_Year":[{"data":{"Year":"57"}},{"data":{"Year":"58"}},{"data":{"Year":"59"}}]}}],"Personal_network":[{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Paul.2479","Name":"Paul"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Claudius.948","Name":"Claudius"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Ananias.260","Name":"Ananias"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Tertullus.2844","Name":"Tertullus"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Drusilla.1024","Name":"Drusilla"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Portius.2367","Name":"Portius"}}],"Member_of_Groups":null,"Verses":[{"data":{"Verse_Num":"24","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.23"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"26","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.23"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"3","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.24"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"22","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.24"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"24","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.24"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"25","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.24"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"27","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.24"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"14","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.25"}}]}}]}}},"pageContext":{"lookup":"Felix.1257"}}
