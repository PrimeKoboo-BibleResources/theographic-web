He was of the sect of the Sadducees ( <a href=\"http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/5-17.html\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/acts/5-17.html\">Acts 5:17</a> ), and was a member of the council when he gave his opinion that Jesus should be put to death \"for the people, and that the whole nation perish not\" ( <a href=\"http://www.biblestudytools.com/john/11-50.html\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/john/11-50.html\">John 11:50</a> ). In these words he unconsciously uttered a prophecy. \"Like Saul, he was a prophet in spite of himself.\" Caiaphas had no power to inflict the punishment of death, and therefore Jesus was sent to Pilate, the Roman governor, that he might duly pronounce the sentence against him ( <a href=\"http://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/27-2.html\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/matthew/27-2.html\">Matthew 27:2</a> ;  <a href=\"http://www.biblestudytools.com/john/18-28.html\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/john/18-28.html\">John 18:28</a> ).
