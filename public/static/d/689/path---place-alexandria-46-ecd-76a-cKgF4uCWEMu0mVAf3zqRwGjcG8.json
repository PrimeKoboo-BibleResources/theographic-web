It was for a long period the greatest of existing cities, for both Nineveh and Babylon had been destroyed, and Rome had not yet risen to greatness. It was the residence of the kings of Egypt for 200 years. It is not mentioned in the Old Testament, and only incidentally in the New. Apollos, eloquent and mighty in the Scriptures, was a native of this city ( <a href=\"http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/18-24.html\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/acts/18-24.html\">Acts 18:24</a> ). Many Jews from Alexandria were in Jerusalem, where they had a synagogue ( <a href=\"http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/6-9.html\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/acts/6-9.html\">Acts 6:9</a> ), at the time of Stephen's martyrdom. At one time it is said that as many as 10,000 Jews resided in this city. It possessed a famous library of 700,000 volumes, which was burned by the Saracens (A.D. 642). It was here that the Hebrew Bible was translated into Greek. This is called the Septuagint version, from the tradition that seventy learned men were engaged in executing it. It was, however, not all translated at one time. It was begun B.C. 280, and finished about B.C. 200 or 150.
