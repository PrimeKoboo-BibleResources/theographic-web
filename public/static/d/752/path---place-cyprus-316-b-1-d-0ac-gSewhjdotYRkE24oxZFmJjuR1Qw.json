The Greek colonists gave it the name of Kypros, from the cyprus, i.e., the henna (see <a href=\"http://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/eastons-bible-dictionary/camphire.html\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/dictionaries/eastons-bible-dictionary/camphire.html\">CAMPHIRE</a>), which grew on this island. It was originally inhabited by Phoenicians. In B.C. 477 it fell under the dominion of the Greeks; and became a Roman province B.C. 58. In ancient times it was a centre of great commercial activity. Corn and wine and oil were produced here in the greatest perfection. It was rich also in timber and in mineral wealth.  <p> It is first mentioned in the New Testament ( <a href=\"http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/4-36.html\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/acts/4-36.html\">Acts 4:36</a> ) as the native place of Barnabas.
