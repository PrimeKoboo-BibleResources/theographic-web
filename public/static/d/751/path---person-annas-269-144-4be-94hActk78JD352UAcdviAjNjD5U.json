In A.D. 25 Caiaphas, who had married the daughter of Annas ( <a href=\"http://www.biblestudytools.com/john/18-13.html\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/john/18-13.html\">John 18:13</a> ), was raised to that office, and probably Annas was now made president of the Sanhedrim, or deputy or coadjutor of the high priest, and thus was also called high priest along with Caiaphas ( <a href=\"http://www.biblestudytools.com/luke/3-2.html\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/luke/3-2.html\">Luke 3:2</a> ). By the Mosaic law the high-priesthood was held for life ( <a href=\"http://www.biblestudytools.com/numbers/3-10.html\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/numbers/3-10.html\">Numbers 3:10</a> ); and although Annas had been deposed by the Roman procurator, the Jews may still have regarded him as legally the high priest. Our Lord was first brought before Annas, and after a brief questioning of him ( <a href=\"/passage/?q=John+18:19-23\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/bible/passage.aspx?q=John+18:19-23&amp;t=niv\">John 18:19-23</a> ) was sent to Caiaphas, when some members of the Sanhedrim had met, and the first trial of Jesus took place ( <a href=\"/passage/?q=Matthew+26:57-68\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/bible/passage.aspx?q=Matthew+26:57-68&amp;t=niv\">Matthew 26:57-68</a> ). This examination of our Lord before Annas is recorded only by John.
