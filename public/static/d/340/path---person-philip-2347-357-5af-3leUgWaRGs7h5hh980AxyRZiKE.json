{"data":{"airtable":{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Philip.2347","Dictionary_Text":"<p>One of the \"seven\" ( <a href=\"http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/6-5.html\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/acts/6-5.html\">Acts 6:5</a> ), called also \"the evangelist\" ( <a href=\"http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/21-8.html\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/acts/21-8.html\">Acts 21:8</a> <a href=\"http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/21-9.html\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/acts/21-9.html\">Acts 21:9</a> ). He was one of those who were \"scattered abroad\" by the persecution that arose on the death of Stephen. He went first to Samaria, where he laboured as an evangelist with much success ( <a href=\"/passage/?q=Acts+8:5-13\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/bible/passage.aspx?q=Acts+8:5-13&amp;t=niv\">8:5-13</a> ). While he was there he received a divine command to proceed toward the south, along the road leading from Jerusalem to Gaza. These towns were connected by two roads. The one Philip was directed to take was that which led through Hebron, and thence through a district little inhabited, and hence called \"desert.\" As he travelled along this road he was overtaken by a chariot in which sat a man of Ethiopia, the eunuch or chief officer of Queen Candace, who was at that moment reading, probably from the Septuagint version, a portion of the prophecies of ( <a href=\"http://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/53-6.html\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/isaiah/53-6.html\">Isaiah 53:6</a> <a href=\"http://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/53-7.html\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/isaiah/53-7.html\">Isaiah 53:7</a> ). Philip entered into conversation with him, and expounded these verses, preaching to him the glad tidings of the Saviour. The eunuch received the message and believed, and was forthwith baptized, and then \"went on his way rejoicing.\" Philip was instantly caught away by the Spirit after the baptism, and the eunuch saw him no more. He was next found at Azotus, whence he went forth in his evangelistic work till he came to Caesarea. He is not mentioned again for about twenty years, when he is still found at Caesarea ( <a href=\"http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/21-8.html\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/acts/21-8.html\">Acts 21:8</a> ) when Paul and his companions were on the way to Jerusalem. He then finally disappears from the page of history.","Aliases":"Philip","Father":null,"Has_Been_to":[{"data":{"Place_Lookup":"Coos.308","ESV_name":"Cos"}},{"data":{"Place_Lookup":"Rhodes.1000","ESV_name":"Rhodes"}},{"data":{"Place_Lookup":"Patara.924","ESV_name":"Patara"}},{"data":{"Place_Lookup":"Phenicia.944","ESV_name":"Phoenicia"}},{"data":{"Place_Lookup":"Cyprus.316","ESV_name":"Cyprus"}},{"data":{"Place_Lookup":"Syria.1122","ESV_name":"Syria"}},{"data":{"Place_Lookup":"Tyre.1184","ESV_name":"Tyre"}},{"data":{"Place_Lookup":"Ptolemais.959","ESV_name":"Ptolemais"}},{"data":{"Place_Lookup":"Caesarea.266","ESV_name":"Caesarea"}},{"data":{"Place_Lookup":"Judea.657","ESV_name":"Judea"}},{"data":{"Place_Lookup":"Gaza.446","ESV_name":"Gaza"}},{"data":{"Place_Lookup":"Samaria.1022","ESV_name":"Samaria"}},{"data":{"Place_Lookup":"Jerusalem.636","ESV_name":"Jerusalem"}}],"Events":[{"data":{"Event_Name":"Seven chosen to serve","Start_Year":[{"data":{"Year":"33"}}]}},{"data":{"Event_Name":"Philip preaches in Samaria","Start_Year":[{"data":{"Year":"34"}}]}},{"data":{"Event_Name":"Conversion of Ethiopian Eunuch","Start_Year":[{"data":{"Year":"34"}}]}},{"data":{"Event_Name":"Voyage from Miletus to Jerusalem","Start_Year":[{"data":{"Year":"57"}}]}}],"Personal_network":[{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Luke.1836","Name":"Luke"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Paul.2479","Name":"Paul"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Agabus.107","Name":"Agabus"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Mnason.2102","Name":"Mnason"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Candace.916","Name":"Candace"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Simon.2752","Name":"Simon"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Peter.2745","Name":"Simon"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"John.1677","Name":"John"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Stephen.2802","Name":"Stephen"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Prochorus.2371","Name":"Prochorus"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Nicanor.2203","Name":"Nicanor"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Timon.2862","Name":"Timon"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Parmenas.2272","Name":"Parmenas"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Nicolas.2205","Name":"Nicolas"}}],"Member_of_Groups":null,"Verses":[{"data":{"Verse_Num":"5","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.6"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"5","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.8"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"6","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.8"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"12","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.8"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"13","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.8"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"26","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.8"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"29","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.8"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"30","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.8"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"31","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.8"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"34","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.8"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"35","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.8"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"37","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.8"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"38","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.8"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"39","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.8"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"40","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.8"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"8","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.21"}}]}}]}}},"pageContext":{"lookup":"Philip.2347"}}
