It is one of the oldest towns in Asia. It was and still is the chief sea-port of Judea. It was never wrested from the Phoenicians. It became a Jewish town only in the second century B.C. It was from this port that Jonah \"took ship to flee from the presence of the Lord\" ( <a href=\"http://www.biblestudytools.com/jonah/1-3.html\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/jonah/1-3.html\">Jonah 1:3</a> ). To this place also the wood cut in Lebanon by Hiram's men for Solomon was brought in floats ( <a href=\"http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-chronicles/2-16.html\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/2-chronicles/2-16.html\">2ï¿½Chronicles 2:16</a> ); and here the material for the building of the second temple was also landed ( <a href=\"http://www.biblestudytools.com/ezra/3-7.html\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/ezra/3-7.html\">Ezra 3:7</a> ). At Joppa, in the house of Simon the tanner, \"by the sea-side,\" Peter resided \"many days,\" and here, \"on the house-top,\" he had his \"vision of tolerance\" ( <a href=\"/passage/?q=Acts+9:36-43\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/bible/passage.aspx?q=Acts+9:36-43&amp;t=niv\">Acts 9:36-43</a> ). It bears the modern name of Jaffa, and exibituds all the decrepitude and squalor of cities ruled over by the Turks. \"Scarcely any other town has been so often overthrown, sacked, pillaged, burned, and rebuilt.\" Its present population is said to be about 16,000. It was taken by the French under Napoleon in 1799, who gave orders for the massacre here of 4,000 prisoners. It is connected with Jerusalem by the only carriage road that exists in the country, and also by a railway completed in 1892. It is noticed on monuments B.C. 1600-1300, and was attacked by Sannacharib B.C. 702.","Place_ID":652,"KJV_Name":"Joppa","Has_been_here":[{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Peter.2745","Name":"Simon"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Cornelius.956","Name":"Cornelius"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Simon.2753","Name":"Simon"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Dorcas.2810","Name":"Dorcas"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Aeneas.106","Name":"Aeneas"}}],"Events_here":[{"data":{"Event_Name":"Peter heals Aeneas and Dorcas","Start_Year":[{"data":{"Year":"41"}}]}},{"data":{"Event_Name":"Peter meets Cornelius","Start_Year":[{"data":{"Year":"41"}}]}}],"Verses":[{"data":{"Verse_Num":"46","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":6,"Osis_Name":"Josh"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Joshua.19"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"16","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":14,"Osis_Name":"2Chr"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"2 Chronicles.2"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"7","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":15,"Osis_Name":"Ezra"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Ezra.3"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"3","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":32,"Osis_Name":"Jonah"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Jonah.1"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"36","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.9"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"38","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.9"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"42","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.9"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"43","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.9"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"5","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.10"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"8","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.10"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"23","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.10"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"32","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.10"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"5","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.11"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"13","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.11"}}]}}]}}},"pageContext":{"lookup":"Joppa.652"}}
