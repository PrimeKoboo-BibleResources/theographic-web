He was so enraged at Paul's noble declaration, \"I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day,\" that he commanded one of his attendants to smite him on the mouth. Smarting under this unprovoked insult, Paul quickly replied, \"God shall smite thee, thou whited wall.\" Being reminded that Ananias was the high priest, to whose office all respect was to be paid, he answered, \"I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest\" ( <a href=\"http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/23-5.html\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/acts/23-5.html\">Acts 23:5</a> ). This expression has occasioned some difficulty, as it is scarcely probable that Paul should have been ignorant of so public a fact. The expression may mean (a) that Paul had at the moment overlooked the honour due to the high priest; or (b), as others think, that Paul spoke ironically, as if he had said, \"The high priest breaking the law! God's high priest a tyrant and a lawbreaker! I see a man in white robes, and have heard his voice, but surely it cannot, it ought not to be, the voice of the high priest.\" (See Dr. Lindsay on Acts, <i> in loco</i> .) (c) Others think that from defect of sight Paul could not observe that the speaker was the high priest. In all this, however, it may be explained, Paul, with all his excellency, comes short of the example of his divine Master, who, when he was reviled, reviled not again.","Aliases":"Ananias","Father":null,"Has_Been_to":[{"data":{"Place_Lookup":"Caesarea.266","ESV_name":"Caesarea"}},{"data":{"Place_Lookup":"Antipatris.70","ESV_name":"Antipatris"}},{"data":{"Place_Lookup":"Jerusalem.636","ESV_name":"Jerusalem"}}],"Events":[{"data":{"Event_Name":"Paul goes before the Council","Start_Year":[{"data":{"Year":"57"}}]}},{"data":{"Event_Name":"Paul sent to Felix","Start_Year":[{"data":{"Year":"57"}},{"data":{"Year":"58"}},{"data":{"Year":"59"}}]}}],"Personal_network":[{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Felix.1257","Name":"Felix"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Claudius.948","Name":"Claudius"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Tertullus.2844","Name":"Tertullus"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Drusilla.1024","Name":"Drusilla"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Portius.2367","Name":"Portius"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Paul.2479","Name":"Paul"}}],"Member_of_Groups":null,"Verses":[{"data":{"Verse_Num":"2","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.23"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"1","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.24"}}]}}]}}},"pageContext":{"lookup":"Ananias.260"}}
