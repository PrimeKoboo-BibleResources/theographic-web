He became a convert to Christianity under Paul, who visited this island on his first mission to the heathen.  <p> A remarkable memorial of this proconsul was recently (1887) discovered at Rome. On a boundary stone of Claudius his name is found, among others, as having been appointed (A.D. 47) one of the curators of the banks and the channel of the river Tiber. After serving his three years as proconsul at Cyprus, he returned to Rome, where he held the office referred to. As he is not saluted in Paul's letter to the Romans, he probably died before it was written.","Aliases":"Sergius Paulus,Paulus,Sergius","Father":null,"Has_Been_to":[{"data":{"Place_Lookup":"Seleucia.1045","ESV_name":"Seleucia"}},{"data":{"Place_Lookup":"Cyprus.316","ESV_name":"Cyprus"}},{"data":{"Place_Lookup":"Salamis.1016","ESV_name":"Salamis"}},{"data":{"Place_Lookup":"Paphos.919","ESV_name":"Paphos"}}],"Events":[{"data":{"Event_Name":"Barnabus and Saul go to Cyprus","Start_Year":[{"data":{"Year":"48"}}]}}],"Personal_network":[{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Mark.1679","Name":"John"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Barnabas.1722","Name":"Barnabas"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Paul.2479","Name":"Paul"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Elymas.403","Name":"Elymas"}}],"Member_of_Groups":null,"Verses":[{"data":{"Verse_Num":"7","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.13"}}]}}]}}},"pageContext":{"lookup":"Sergius.2502"}}
