{"data":{"airtable":{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Matthew.1971","Dictionary_Text":"<p>gift of God, a common Jewish name after the Exile. He was the son of Alphaeus, and was a publican or tax-gatherer at Capernaum. On one occasion Jesus, coming up from the side of the lake, passed the custom-house where Matthew was seated, and said to him, \"Follow me.\" Matthew arose and followed him, and became his disciple ( <a href=\"http://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/9-9.html\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/matthew/9-9.html\">Matthew 9:9</a> ). Formerly the name by which he was known was Levi ( <a href=\"http://www.biblestudytools.com/mark/2-14.html\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/mark/2-14.html\">Mark 2:14</a> ;  <a href=\"http://www.biblestudytools.com/luke/5-27.html\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/luke/5-27.html\">Luke 5:27</a> ); he now changed it, possibly in grateful memory of his call, to Matthew. The same day on which Jesus called him he made a \"great feast\" ( <a href=\"http://www.biblestudytools.com/luke/5-29.html\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/luke/5-29.html\">Luke 5:29</a> ), a farewell feast, to which he invited Jesus and his disciples, and probably also many of old associates. He was afterwards selected as one of the twelve ( <a href=\"http://www.biblestudytools.com/luke/6-15.html\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/luke/6-15.html\">6:15</a> ). His name does not occur again in the Gospel history except in the lists of the apostles. The last notice of him is in  <a href=\"http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/1-13.html\" target=\"_blank\" url=\"/acts/1-13.html\">Acts 1:13</a> . The time and manner of his death are unknown.","Aliases":"Matthew,Levi","Father":[{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Alphaeus.193","Name":"Alphaeus"}}],"Has_Been_to":[{"data":{"Place_Lookup":"Jerusalem.636","ESV_name":"Jerusalem"}}],"Events":[{"data":{"Event_Name":"Matthias replaces Judas","Start_Year":[{"data":{"Year":"33"}}]}}],"Personal_network":[{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Peter.2745","Name":"Simon"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"James.718","Name":"James"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"John.1677","Name":"John"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Andrew.264","Name":"Andrew"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Philip.2344","Name":"Philip"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Thomas.2851","Name":"Thomas"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Bartholomew.405","Name":"Bartholomew"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Alphaeus.192","Name":"Alphaeus"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Simon.2746","Name":"Simon"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Lebbaeus.1815","Name":"Lebbaeus"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Mary.1938","Name":"Mary"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Barsabas.1720","Name":"Barsabas"}},{"data":{"Person_Lookup":"Matthias.1972","Name":"Matthias"}}],"Member_of_Groups":[{"data":{"Group_Name":"Apostles"}},{"data":{"Group_Name":"Apostles (Post-Ascension)"}},{"data":{"Group_Name":"Apostles (The Eleven)"}}],"Verses":[{"data":{"Verse_Num":"9","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":40,"Osis_Name":"Matt"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Matthew.9"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"3","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":40,"Osis_Name":"Matt"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Matthew.10"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"14","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":41,"Osis_Name":"Mark"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Mark.2"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"18","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":41,"Osis_Name":"Mark"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Mark.3"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"27","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":42,"Osis_Name":"Luke"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Luke.5"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"29","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":42,"Osis_Name":"Luke"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Luke.5"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"15","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":42,"Osis_Name":"Luke"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Luke.6"}}]}},{"data":{"Verse_Num":"13","Book":[{"data":{"Canonical_Order":44,"Osis_Name":"Acts"}}],"Chapter":[{"data":{"Chapter_Lookup":"Acts.1"}}]}}]}}},"pageContext":{"lookup":"Matthew.1971"}}
