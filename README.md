# Overview
Theographic will solve two basic problems with Bible applications: poor search experience and difficult navigation among resources. Search results will differentiate people, places, events, and other subjects instead of simple word matching. After arriving on a page, Theographic serves up all collected facts about a subject. Users arrive at these pages with one click on a subjectâ€™s name wherever it appears. Learn more: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9qHbpYZX3k
